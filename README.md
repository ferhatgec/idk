## idk c++ libraries, _work in progress_

idk libraries are designed to improve code base using some standard library function and class approaches. this does not mean that idk libraries 
are designed to run on every architecture and operating system well, also does not mean that idk libraries are an alternative to c++ standard library.
it's neither contains all structures of standard or supports everything as optimized. 

idk libraries also designed to help developers for implementing frequently used functions (based on stackoverflow upvotes, i mean it's like that) built in.

idk both means 'i don\'t know' and 'i do know', if something implemented, idk knows that, something's not implemented, then idk doesn't know that.
